Tests from tcc, originally from picoc.
See http://bellard.org/tcc/, https://code.google.com/p/picoc/.

These tests do not compile with Smaller C now:
12.c (better preprocessor needed)
22.c (floating point arithmetic / <math.h> needed)
23.c (floating point arithmetic / <math.h> needed)
24.c (floating point arithmetic / <math.h> needed)
41.c (better preprocessor needed)
55.c (better preprocessor needed)
