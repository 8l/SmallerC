Smaller C is a simple and small single-pass C compiler.

Currently it generates 16-bit and 32-bit 80386+ assembly code for NASM
that can then be assembled and linked into DOS, Windows and Linux programs.

Code generation for MIPS CPUs is also supported.

The compiler is capable of compiling its own source code.
